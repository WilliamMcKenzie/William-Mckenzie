            Quizzgen was made as my CS50 final project, but I saw potential to make it much cooler and expand my idea. After tweaking the design and prompts I ended up with speedy and high quality quizzes at the click of a button. The idea was originally to learn new concepts using the same approach as Duolingo, but I realized that was kind of stupid as learning a language is largely about pattern recognition while learning other topics has more nuance. So I pivoted to turn it into a pure quiz generator, to test yourself on knowledge and add in sharing features to bring a community aspect.
